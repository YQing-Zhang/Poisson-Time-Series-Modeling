This project involves building and fitting a Poisson time series model from scratch to analyze daily event counts, commonly used in the epidemiology of non-infectious 
diseases. The Monte Carlo method was employed for parameter estimation due to its flexibility in handling complex integrals, while Newtonâ€™s method was used for latent 
variable estimation because of its fast convergence. The project calculated point estimates and confidence intervals for the model parameters, and discussed computational
advantages and limitations, particularly the efficient use of sparse matrices, ensuring computational efficiency even with large datasets.
